    <h3>Welcome to Math Magicians!!</h3>
    <p>
      A mathematician is a person who can find
      analogies between theorems; a better mathematician is one
      who can see analogies between proofs and the best mathematician
      can notice analogies between theories.But above all I wish to
      designate the following as the most important among the numerous
      questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove
      that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of
      logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elegance of a mathematical theorem
      is directly proportional to the number of independent ideas one
      can see in the theorem and inversely proportional to the effort it takes to see them.
